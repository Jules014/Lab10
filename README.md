This is my code for the lab assignment 10. This code counts the number of occurrences a word has in a list. 

To run simply compile and run trieCode.c with your local C compiler in a manner such as...
cc trieCode.c -o trieCode
./trieCode

To clone this repository use a command such as:
git clone https://github.com/Jules014/Lab10.git 

The output for this code should be as follows:
    notaword : 1
    ucf : 1
    no : 1
    note : 1
    corg : 1
